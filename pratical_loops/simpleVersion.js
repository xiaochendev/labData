// Part 1: Fizz Buzz
// To begin, solve the following classic “Fizz Buzz” problem. There are a few different ways to do this - experiment with what you think is the most efficient. Once you have solved the problem, ask yourself if there could be another way; and if so, would it be better.
// Accomplish the following:
    // Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100.
    // If a number is divisible by 3, log “Fizz.”
    // If a number is divisible by 5, log “Buzz.”
    // If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log “Fizz Buzz.”
    // If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, log the number.
// Remember to commit your solution once it is working.


// Part 2: Prime Time (No Rush)
// Now we will move onto something slightly more complex.
// Context: A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it cannot be divided by 4, 3, or 2; it can only be divided by itself (5) and 1. Similarly, the numbers 7 and 11 are prime. As numbers become larger, determining whether or not they are prime is increasingly difficult, but loops make this process relatively easy!
// Write a script that accomplishes the following:
    // Declare an arbitrary number, n.
    // Create a loop that searches for the next prime number, starting at n and incrementing from there.
    // As soon as you find the prime number, log that number and exit the loop.

// Continuing with the example above, if n is equal to 4, your loop should log 5. Similarly, if n is 5, it should log 7, and if n is 9, it should log 11. Test your loop with higher numbers and reference an online prime number table to determine the accuracy of your code.
// Be careful! If you set n to a number too large, your loop could take a long time to process.


// Part 3: Feeling Loopy(*** MORE IMPORTANT***)
// As a final task, solve the following practical problem regarding string processing.
// Context: A CSV file, or “Comma-Separated Values” file is traditionally used to store tabular data. 
// You may be familiar with CSVs through past use of programs such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. 
// While each of these programs save their data in different formats to preserve style (
// e.g., font color or cell backgrounds), at their core, they are storing CSV data.
// CSV data looks like this:
    // ID,Name,Occupation,Age\n42,Bruce,Knight,41\n57,Bob,Fry Cook,19\n63,Blaine,Quiz Master,58\n98,Bill,Doctor’s Assistant,26

// Not very nice to look at. The “\n” is an escaped Line Feed, which indicates that the following data should begin on a new line, as follows:
    // ID,Name,Occupation,Age
    // 42,Bruce,Knight,41
    // 57,Bob,Fry Cook,19
    // 63,Blaine,Quiz Master,58
    // 98,Bill,Doctor’s Assistant,26
// As you may have guessed, these values being “comma-separated” means that each comma is also 
// a delimiter. This is why this type of data is traditionally viewed in tables. 
// Here is how the data looks once fully parsed:
        //      ID      Name        Occupation      Age
        //      42      Bruce       Knight          41
        //      57      Bob         Fry Cook        19
        //      63      Blanie      Quiz Master     58
        //      98      Bill        Doctor's Ass    26


// Your task is to write a script that accomplishes the following:
    // Loop through the characters of a given CSV string.
    // Store each “cell” of data in a variable.
    // When you encounter a comma, move to the next cell.
    // When you encounter the “\r\n” sequence, move to the next “row.”
    // Log each row of data.
        // You do not need to format the data, the following works well.
        // console.log(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4);
// You can make the following assumptions:
    // There will only be 4 cells per row.
    // There will be no escaped characters other than “\n”.
// Use the example string provided above to test your program. Once you are confident 
// it is working correctly, try the following string to see if your program works properly with other data.
        // Index,Mass (kg),Spring 1 (m),Spring 2
        // (m)\n1,0.00,0.050,0.050\n2,0.49,0.066,0.066\n3,0.98,0.087,0.080\n4,1.47,0.116
        // ,0.108\n5,1.96,0.142,0.138\n6,2.45,0.166,0.158\n7,2.94,0.193,0.174\n8,3.43,0.
        // 204,0.192\n9,3.92,0.226,0.205\n10,4.41,0.238,0.232
